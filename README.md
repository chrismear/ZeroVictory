Installation
------------

Download the installer package from the Downloads section:

[https://github.com/chrismear/ZeroVictory/downloads](https://github.com/chrismear/ZeroVictory/downloads)

and open it.

When it's finished installing, you'll need to restart Mail.

Excuses
-------

This is very hacky, assuredly buggy, written quickly, and tested only on Mac OS X 10.6.6 running on x86_64. YMMV.

Basically, it checks your inbox message count whenever you move or delete messages out of it. Sometimes it fails because Mail takes a while to delete a message, even though it appears the message has already been deleted.
